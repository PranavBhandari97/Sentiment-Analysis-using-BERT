# Sentiment Analysis using BERT

## Problem Statement
#### The goal of this project was to build a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model, to predict the sentiment of viewers from the IMDB movies dataset.

## Model
#### A simple text classification model using BERT was designed. The reviews were restricted to a maximum length of 500 words. Ktrain was used to calculate the learning rate, and to train the model as well. A validation accuracy of 93.71% was achieved by the model. A predict cell was given as well to try how the model performed to new reviews.
